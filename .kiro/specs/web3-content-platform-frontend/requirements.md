# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a production-ready React.js 18 + TypeScript frontend for a walletless Web3 content platform that combines YouTube and TikTok functionality. The platform enables users to upload, watch, and monetize video content through a seamless Web3 experience without traditional wallet complexity. The frontend will communicate with a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) via REST APIs and real-time WebSocket connections.
