# Content Discovery Platform Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive content discovery and user library system that enables viewers to explore, organize, and manage video content. The platform will include subscription feeds, content exploration, trending videos, viewing history, playlist management, and personal video libraries while maintaining the existing Home page and long-form video player functionality unchanged.
